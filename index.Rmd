The survey taken at the beginning of the class asked `r data_info[1]` questions of `r data_info[2]` students. These questions revealed that the average number of countries visited by students was `r data_info[3]`. Out of the `r data_info[2]` students, `r data_info[4]` of them use macs and `r data_info[5]` use windows based machines.
